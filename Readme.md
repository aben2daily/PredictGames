Here are the endpoint for now, though I will work to lace swagger on the rest API to make it easily readable.

create = localhost/GamePrediction/api/league/create.php

update = localhost/GamePrediction/api/league/update.php

list all league = localhost/GamePrediction/api/league/getAll.php

find a league = localhost/GamePrediction/api/league/getleague.php?id=

Member Apis

create = localhost/GamePrediction/api/member/create.php

update = localhost/GamePrediction/api/member/update.php

list all member = localhost/GamePrediction/api/member/getAll.php

find a member = localhost/GamePrediction/api/member/getMember.php?id=
